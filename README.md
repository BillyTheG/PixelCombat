# PixelCombat

PixelCombat is a self-written 2D Beat'em Up Game in Java. It includes: An Arcade Mode (TODO), VS Player and VS AI.
All characters (sprites and other materials) are mostly taken from well-known platforms (Anime World e.g. One Piece, Fairy Tail, DBZ ...) and do not belong to my creation. Hence, this game was designed for only fun and is not meant for sale and commercial. 

<b>Motivation</b>

Have you ever found one completed beat'em up game written in java? Until now I could not find a proper tutorial to write LOC to realize such a funny game. My plan is to give one example, how such game can be made. Maybe you have more experiences than me in this field.
I would appreciate any tip/help/advice. 

<b>History</b>

During my study (Computer Science) we were instructed to do a small java project about programing minigames. I had chosen the "Little Fighter" Game".

The game should not be too complex and comprehensible for any beginner. So we kept the game really simple and implemented only few characters with only two attacks and a really low amount of possible actions (move, jump, basicAttack and one special attack)

When we "finished" the project for getting only the credit points, I was not fully satisfied with the situation. The project made so much fun and I wanted to work more on it. So, my decision was to develop a fully-detailed fighting game made purely by java. In my childhood I liked those kind of games and so I want(ed) to implement my own fighting game. Of course I am inspired by the brand names "Street Fighter, Tekken, LF2 and DBZ Budokai" and so on, therefore I do not own the ideas and the basic concepts!
Here is one video, how it looks like today.

<b>Future plans</b>

-> More Characters
-> Tutorials
-> Online
-> Adroid/IOS Support

<b>Current Work</b>

-> Bugs, Bugs, Bugs... everywhere
-> Performance handling (need to assist the garbage collector with included memory management)
-> Improving Menu
